# OpenVPN Client with proxy for Docker

Using this image will allow you establish a VPN connection usable by other containers without having to install a VPN client on the host. The image requires the user to supply the needed OpenVPN configuration files, so (probably) any VPN provider will work.

## Creating

### `docker run`

```
docker run -d \
  --name=openvpn-client \
  --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
  --device=/dev/net/tun \
  -v <path/to/config>:/data
  yacht7/openvpn-client
```

### `docker-compose`

```
version: '2'

services:
    openvpn-client:
        image: yacht7/openvpn-client
        container_name: openvpn-client
        cap_add:
            - NET_ADMIN
        devices:
            - /dev/net/tun
        volumes:
            - <path/to/config>:/data
        restart: unless-stopped
```

#### Considerations

##### Tinyproxy

To use Tinyproxy, you'll want to publish port 8888 to access the proxy. To do that, add `-p 8888:8888` if you're using `docker run`, or add the below snippet to the `openvpn-client` service definition in your Compose file if using `docker-compose`.

```
ports:
    - 8888:8888
```

##### Handling ports intended for connected containers

If you plan on having [other containers use `openvpn-client`'s network stack](#using-with-other-containers) and those containers have web UIs, you'll want to publish the web UI ports on `openvpn-client` instead of the connected container. To do that, add `-p <host_port>:<container_port>` if you're using `docker run`, or add the below snippet to the `openvpn-client` service definition in your Compose file if using `docker-compose`.

```
ports:
    - <host_port>:<container_port>
```

In both cases, replace `<host_port>` and `<container_port>` with the port used by your connected container.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default (blank is unset) | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `3` | OpenVPN verbosity (`1`-`11`) |
| `TINYPROXY_PORT` | `8888` | The port that Tinyproxy listens on. If manually specified, choose a port over 1024. |
| `TINYPROXY_USER` | | Setting `TINYPROXY_USER` and `TINYPROXY_PASS` will restrict access to the proxy server to only the specified username and password. |
| `TINYPROXY_PASS` | | Setting `TINYPROXY_USER` and `TINYPROXY_PASS` will restrict access to the proxy server to only the specified username and password. |

## Running

### Verifying functionality

Once you have container running `yacht7/openvpn-client`, run the following command to spin up a temporary container using `openvpn-client` for networking. The `wget -qO - ifconfig.me` bit will return the public IP of the container (and anything else using `openvpn-client` for networking). You should see an IP address owned by your VPN provider.
```
docker run --rm -it --network=container:openvpn-client alpine wget -qO - ifconfig.me
```

### Using with other containers

Once you have your OpenVPN client container up and running, you can tell other containers to use `openvpn-client`'s network stack which gives any container the ability to utilize the VPN tunnel. There are a few ways to accomplish this depending how how your container is created.

If your container is being created with
1. the same Compose YAML file as `openvpn-client`, add `network_mode: service:openvpn-client` to the container's service definition.
2. a different Compose YAML file as `openvpn-client`, add `network_mode: container:openvpn-client` to the container's service definition.
3. `docker run`, add `--network=container:openvpn-client` as an option to `docker run`.

Once running and provided your container has `wget` or `curl`, you can run `docker exec <container_name> wget -qO - ifconfig.me` or `docker exec <container_name> curl -s ifconfig.me` to get the public IP of the container and make sure everything is working as expected. This IP should match the one of `openvpn-client`.

If the connected container needs to publish ports, see [this](#handling-ports-intended-for-connected-containers) section.
